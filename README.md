## Description

  Using the command line, I have built an app that takes users information about employees and generates it into an html webpage. Depending on the various answers to the prompts, it will sumarize the answers about each added employee. Inquirer and Jest packages were used building this application. Inquirer was used for prompting the user with questions and answers for each team member. Jest was used to test classes to make sure everything worked as intended. The app was built through Javascript and node.js.
